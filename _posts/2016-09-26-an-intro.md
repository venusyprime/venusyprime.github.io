So, this is something I've wanted to do for a while.

This is vei.space, a place to share my thoughts about personal issues and help with technical things. Because while I use my Tumblr a lot, it's mainly for reblogging content other people have made, rather than sharing my own. My objective here is to write at least one blog post a month. Not a huge one, just... something.

My first planned post is some general notes on my philosophy in life, before I move onto the more technical challenges I've been facing recently.
